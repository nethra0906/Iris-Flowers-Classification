The goal was to classify flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica—based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. This beginner-friendly project provided a solid foundation in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning algorithms. Additionally, by exploring advanced algorithms and techniques, I was able to enhance the project further, making it a valuable addition to my deep learning portfolio.
