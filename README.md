**Flower Species Classification Using Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This project focuses on classifying flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica—based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. It provides a solid foundation in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning algorithms.

**Objectives**
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
**Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset.
**Model Building:** Develop and train machine learning models.
**Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models and optimize them.

**Tools and Libraries**
**Python:** Programming language used for analysis.
**Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model building.
**Pandas:** Data manipulation.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization.

**Steps**

**1.Data Preprocessing**
**Handle Missing Values:** Impute or remove missing data.
**Normalize Features:** Scale features for better model performance.
**Split Data:** Divide the data into training and testing sets.

**2.Feature Engineering**
**Extract Features:** Identify and extract relevant features from the dataset.
**Create New Features:** Generate new features if necessary.

**3.Model Building**
**Define Models:** Set up machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
**Train Models:** Train the models on the training data.
**Tune Hyperparameters:** Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.

**4.Evaluation**
**Performance Metrics:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate models.
**Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of different models.

**Results**
The machine learning models achieved high accuracy in classifying the flower species, demonstrating the effectiveness of feature engineering and model optimization.

Conclusion
This beginner-friendly project provided a solid foundation in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning algorithms, making it a valuable addition to a deep learning portfolio.
